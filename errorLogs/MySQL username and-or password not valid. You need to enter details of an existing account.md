This was the main issue I faced, and lost time on. It appeared at the end of the NextCloud configuration, when creating my admin NextCloud account and linking my MariaDB to NextCloud.

_**Root**_: From whatever reason, NextCloud cannot find the user account of the MariaDB database you mentionned...

_**Solution**_: 
To solve the issue, I deleted my MariaDB data base (originally created via the DSM interface) and created a new database using the terminal.

The idea is to GRANT ALL priviledge to the user. I did this at the beggining and added the FLUSH PRIVILEGES and it worked....

```
Example: 

CREATE DATABASE your_NextCloud_Data_Base_Name; #replace your_NextCloud_Data_Base_Name

CREATE USER 'your_Next_Cloud_User'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_Password'; #replace your_Next_Cloud_User

GRANT ALL ON your_NextCloud_Data_Base_Name .* TO 'your_NextCloud_User'@'localhost'; #your_NextCloud_User

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```
